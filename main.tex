%To support these initiatives, TMM has proposed a 
%budget of around USD 442,000 for 2024. This includes funding for relief supplies, visiting scholar program, equipment, transportation, and program activities.
% , upgrade equipment and maintenance capabilities,

%The goal is to exchange specialty knowledge, expand access to care, and improve public health outreach. This will build local capacity at HGH through collaboration between Somaliland and Taiwanese healthcare professionals.




\section{Introduction}
%Cervical cancer remains one of the top causes of cancer deaths among women in Somaliland, with mortality rates estimated to be over 20 per 100,000, more than 4 times higher than Taiwan. 

Cervical cancer is a preventable and curable disease, yet it remains the 4th most common form of cancer among women worldwide. 
Despite having successfully implemented a national cervical cancer screening program since 1995 in Taiwan that has reduced incidence and mortality by over 70\%, screening coverage in Somaliland remains extremely low, well under 5\%.
Barriers to screening include limited medical infrastructure and personnel, low awareness among women, and sociocultural taboos. Our Taiwan Medical Mission team has been collaborating with Hargeisa Group Hospital since July 2023 to establish cervical cytology capacity. With enormous effort, we have set up Somaliland's first Pap smear screening clinic in HGH. However, much work remains to expand services, train local staff, and educate women to utilize screening.
To accelerate progress in saving women's lives, we propose a concentrated one-month training program and screening campaign since April 2024. Renowned OB/GYN doctors from Taiwan will provide hands-on instruction in specimen collection and developing streamlined screening protocols. Leading pathologist Dr. Chang will conduct intensive Pap stain, cytology, and pathology workshops to increase the quality and efficiency of interpretation. 

%This project seeks to expand screening and treatment capacity for all women ages 21-65 at risk of cervical abnormalities.
% https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/screening.htm

The Taiwan Medical Mission proposes a medical campaign called "WHO Cervical Cancer Elimination Day of Action" to launch an awareness drive across Hargeisa to motivate women to get screened from April 2024 to November 2024. Our hashtags are \#GlowTeal and \#CervicalCancer.

%
The Cervical Cancer Elimination Day of Action is an annual event that takes place on November 17th. It marks the anniversary of the launch of the "Global Strategy to Accelerate the Elimination of Cervical Cancer" as a public health problem by the World Health Organization (WHO).
In May 2018, the WHO Director-General announced a global call for action to eliminate cervical cancer, underscoring renewed political will to make elimination a reality and calling for all stakeholders to unite behind this common goal. In August 2020, the World Health Assembly adopted the Global Strategy for cervical cancer elimination. Now is the time to act to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem.


%

Cervical cancer screening can help detect abnormal cells in the cervix before they develop into cancer. The two main types of cervical cancer screening tests are the Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA test and the Pap test.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a commonly transmitted infection that can cause 70\% of cervical cancer in women. HPV infection often has no symptoms, so many people may not know they have it. There are many different types of HPV, some of which can cause cancer.
An HPV DNA test can identify high-risk HPV varieties (i.e., 16 and 18) that are most likely to cause cervical cancer.
These tests are advised for women aged 30 to 49, with regular testing every 5â€“10 years.
During a Pap test, a sample of cells from the cervix is obtained and analyzed for abnormalities by a cytologist.
Moreover, WHO has renewed its recommendations for screening and treatment of cervical cancer, making clear that HPV DNA-based tests are more efficient than cytology-based tests (i.e., Pap test), especially for low- and middle-income countries, because they are less prone to quality problems (WHO 2021: \Url{https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/11-09-2021-who-recommends-dna-testing-as-a-first-choice-screening-method-for-cervical-cancer-prevention}).


If abnormal cells or HPV infection are detected during cervical cancer screening, further testing and treatment may be necessary. Treatment options for pre-cancerous lesions include biopsy, cryosurgery, laser surgery, loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), cold knife conization, and abdominal total hysterectomy (ATH). These treatments aim to remove abnormal cells, which will be investigated by a pathologist for diagnosis and safety margin of tumor.

We will propose using the "screen-triage-treat" approach via HPV DNA testing, which has been recognized by the WHO as the primary screening method for eliminating cervical cancer globally.
We plan to build referral networks for precancer treatment and cancer care.
This project will also enable the HPV self-sampling initiative, a widely used HPV testing method, to discover best practices in low-resource service delivery.


%%% why breast cancer screening
Breast cancer is also among the most common and fatal cancers affecting women globally. According to WHO, breast cancer accounts for nearly 12\% of all new annual cancer cases and is the second leading cause of cancer death among women. In low and middle-income African countries, outcomes are worse due to more advanced staging at diagnosis and lack of adequate screening programs and cancer therapy resources. 

Breast cancer screening in Taiwan has evolved over the past two decades. Mammography screening is recommended for average-risk women ages 45-69 every 2 years. In 2002, Taiwan launched a nationwide breast cancer screening program providing biennial mammography for women 45-69 along with clinical breast exams.


Implementing mammogram screening for women during the target cervical cancer screening age range can enable early breast cancer detection in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Managing any detected abnormalities or positive cancer diagnoses would be facilitated through support from the visiting TMM general surgeon during his time onsite in 2024. Overall, adding mammography and breast cancer diagnosis/treatment components serves to make the service model even more comprehensive and impactful for this population.


%%%%
\section{Aim}

Improve early detection and management of cervical precancer/cancer in Somaliland by expanding screening coverage and treatment access. This aligns with WHOâ€™s vision for attaining the highest possible level of sexual and reproductive health worldwide, in which cervical cancer is an eliminable disease.
As per WHO's Global Strategy adopted in 2020, this project aims to accelerate Somalilandâ€™s progress towards the 2030 targets of 90\% HPV vaccination coverage, 70\% cervical cancer screening coverage, and 90\% access to pre-cancer treatment and cancer care including palliative services. 

%Our mission is aligned with WHOâ€™s Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research (SRH) division which has driven the adoption of the cervical cancer elimination resolution and strategy. With the tools available today, eliminating cervical cancer is within reach - but only with concerted effort can these live-saving interventions reach all women in need.

\section{Methods}
\begin{itemize}

\item[] \textbf{TMM Visiting Specialists}
Comprehensive Cervical Cancer Control (CCCC) seeks to expand screening and treatment support for women at risk of cervical abnormalities. 
Gynecologist Dr. Chun-Sen Hsu and Dr. Yu-Hsin Huang from Taiwan will collaborate with Dr. Fatima, Director of OB/GYN at Hargeisa Group Hospital, from April-September 2024.
They will provide specialized gynecologic care, perform additional cervical cancer screening via HPV/Pap testing, conduct workshops on navigating cervical abnormalities and cancer, and develop tailored protocols for managing cervical health for Somaliland women.

General surgeon doctor from Taiwan will be onsite February-July 2024. He can assist and teach with evaluating abnormal breast imaging findings, performing ultrasounds and biopsies for suspicious lesions, advising on breast cancer treatment options, and providing minor surgical procedures if feasible. Coordinating mammogram screening during his visit will enable diagnostic workup and treatment connections for any detected breast abnormalities or cancers.

\item[]\textbf{Training Activities}
% Describe training workshops, screening drive, awareness campaign, etc.

\begin{itemize}
\item Hands-on HPV DNA and Pap smear workshops for OB/GYN and midwives
\item Pap stain methodology sessions for pathology technicians
\item Cytology/pathology sessions for pathologist doctors
\item Lectures on international best practices and quality assurance
\item Joint discussions to develop standardized protocols for cervical cancer (and breast cancer) screening, diagnosis, and treatment

\end{itemize}

%%%%
\item[]\textbf{Screening Campaign}


The campaign will implement several strategies to improve cervical cancer prevention and screening in Somaliland: 

\begin{outline} 
\1 In-person communication and information material at Hargeisa Group Hospital (HGH): This can include brochures, posters, A5-sized notes from the hospital information system (HIS) at OPD, and other informational materials that explain the importance of breast/cervical cancer screening, how to get screened with ultrasound, mammogram, HPV DNA test, and Pap smear, and the benefits of vaccination against HPV. 
\1 Media promotions through TV, radio, posters, and social media
\1 Better recall through SMS (Telesom or Somtel) written in Somali languages: A system (a.k.a. \textbf{PathoPush}) can be set up to send reminders to women through SMS. These reminders can include information about how to attend a screening, recall for further therapy in case of abnormal findings of HPV DNA test or Pap smear, and when their next screening is due.
\1 Incentives: People can be encouraged to attend screenings through free health checks, small gifts (like multivitamin tablets), recognition, or small rewards. 
\1 Offering breast ultrasound, mammogram and cervical cancer screening together during a screening campaign can provide women with the opportunity to have two important health screenings at the same time. 
\1 Verbal communication through seminars and workshops: Seminars and workshops can be organized to educate women about their risk of cancer and the importance of screening. 
\1 Screening approaches:
    \2 screen-treat method: Taking HPV DNA and Pap smear, then follow or treat according to cytology result by PathoPush system
    \2 screen-triage-treat (mobileODT) at once: It offers a full turnkey diagnostic and treatment program utilizing the HPV DNA rapid test, the EVAPro digital colposcope, and loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP)/conization (or thermocoagulation, ThermoGlide) treatment of precancerous lesions
\1 Connect cancer-diagnosed patients to available treatment options (referral for breast cancer and cervical cancer)
\1 Provide incentives support for Somaliland local medical team involved in breast/cervical cancer prevention workflow
\end{outline}

%
\begin{itemize}
\item Media promotions through TV, radio, posters, hospital bus, and social media
%\item Patient navigator support and follow-up system
\item Streamlined workflow to maximize patients screened
\item Streamlined protocols for processing specimens, patient tracking, results notification, and follow-up
\item Data collection on screening statistics and outcomes (openEMR system)
\item Scientific publication
\item Policy suggestion for Ministry of Health Development (MoHD)
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
%%%%

\section{Sustainability} 
To ensure the sustainability of the project, several measures will be implemented: 

\begin{outline} 
\1 Collaboration with local organizations: Partnering with local organizations can help to ensure that the campaign is culturally sensitive and tailored to the needs of the local population. 
\1 Training of healthcare professionals: Training healthcare professionals on the importance of cervical cancer screening and how to perform HPV DNA tests and Pap smears can help to ensure that women receive high-quality care. 
\1 Regular follow-up: Regular follow-up with women who have attended screenings can help to ensure that they receive appropriate care if any abnormalities are detected. 
\1 Data collection and analysis: Collecting data on the number of women who attend screenings, the results of their tests, and any follow-up care they receive can help to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign and identify areas for improvement. 
\1 Funding: Securing long-term funding for the campaign from organizations such as WHO, Prevent Cancer Foundation, or European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) can help to ensure its sustainability.
